🧩 How It Works

Users (students and tutors) create accounts through registration pages.

Students browse tutor listings and select a preferred tutor.

A session booking request is created and sent to the tutor.

Tutors can approve or decline booking requests.

Once approved, the session becomes active and visible to the student.

Users can manage bookings and update their personal information anytime.
